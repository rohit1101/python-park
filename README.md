### Fundamentals of Python

Token is a **smallest** and **fundamental** unit of a python script.

Types of tokens:
- **Punctuators** - `[]`, `{}`, `()` 
- **Literals** - "hello" is a string literal, 5 is a integer literal, 3.0 is a flot literal and so on which basically means a single thing in a program
- **Keyword** - think of it as predefined "words" in the python language which we cannot use anywhere in a script.
- **Identifier** - Name(s) that we provide for a variable
- **Operators** - Basic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `\`, `\\`, `%` and advanced operators like `and`, `or`, `not`, `in`, and `not in` etc.

Finally, I feel liberated because Everything in python is an `object`, every JavaScript developer can understand the feeling of objects ðŸ˜†

Primitive datatypes => Integer `int()`, Float `float()`, Boolean `bool()` and String `str()`
